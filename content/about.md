Southerner meets San Francisco. I began my career in a newsroom, made a home in Oman and Austin along the way. 

I love the written word and figuring out the 'why?' in things. Welcome to my journey into UX design. I'm learning to code and build this site piece by piece. Join me on this journey. Pull up a chair and I'll pour you a drink.
