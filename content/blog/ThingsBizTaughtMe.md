*Success isn’t guaranteed but failure is certain if you aren’t emotionally invested in your work. -Biz, Things A Little Bird Told Me*

Each week, Tradecraft welcomes experts and inspiring entrepreneurs to share their insights with us during what we call a “Tradecraft teach.” A couple of weeks ago, I was elated to moderate a talk with Biz Stone.

If you’re not familiar with Biz, he’s the co-founder of Twitter and Jelly, which recently released a fun new app called <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/17/biz-stone-super/" target="_blank">Super</a>. What I find inspiring about Biz’s journey to tech and ultimate success is how optimistic his philosophy on career has remained.

As a fellow optimist, it’s refreshing to meet a leader that is unapologetically empathetic and positive. It’s this outlook that promoted me to invite Biz to Tradecraft, knowing that what he had to share would particularly resonate in a room full of driven people looking to change a little bit of the world.

At Tradecraft, we say that we’re like chefs in a kitchen, responsible for creating our own our success. Or as Biz puts it, “opportunity is manufactured.”

*If something’s fun, a lot of people will use it. If a lot of people use it, then it can be important. -Biz*

One of the most impactful things Biz shared was on the subject of fun. As a designer, I want to create products that bring users joy. Beauty, simplicity and refreshment are all things I hope users would find within the products I build but Biz reminded me that fun should be touted right along with these attributes. There is an importance to having fun — both in the creation of your product and in the product’s function.

If you’ve played around with Super, you’ll notice that it’s primary function isn’t serious — it’s just fun. When it launched, someone wrote that the app looked like the offspring of Andy Warhol and Dr. Seuss. It’s true. Super is delightfully different.

And perhaps that’s the key to creating things that resonate with users. Don’t worry about what everyone else is creating. Be fun, be creative and love what you build.

What Biz reiterates, to have fun and build things you genuinely like, is of course sometimes easier said than done but it’s a challenge that should be worth pursuing.

We enter Tradecraft because we want to change things and create companies, products and features that really make a difference to people. In the journey of ever “disrupting” an industry to create change, it’s important to not lose sight of your passion — for the product and the people you are creating it for. And to make the things you build actually fun to use. I think Biz would agree.
