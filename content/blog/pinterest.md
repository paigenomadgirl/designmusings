Pinterest. The name needs no introduction. Nary is there a wedding or birthday party nowdays without at least *some* aspect of Pinterest influence. I admit that I am a fan and an avid user of the mobile app. My love of Pinterest was a big inspiration behind choosing this as my P2P project. I focused this project on Pinterest's mobile app for Android and looked at ways to maximize a user's main feed. Specifically, I addressed adding a filter feature to the main feed. This would allow users to filter their main feed to feature only those categories they're interested in. 

You can currently search for a category but it will pull in all pins, as opposed to only those you followed have pinned. 

My thinking: you've already curated your content. A filter button would allow you to curate it further. **Persona Development**I began by building a persona around Alee, a busy mother who looks to Pinterest for inspiration in her DIY home. 

{{% figure src="/images/Persona.jpg" %}}**Design Stories**After creating my persona and flushing out Alee's behaviors, wants and needs, I moved to my design stories. This helped me understand what exactly the Pinterest filter feature will allow Alee to do (Alee can...).**Task Flow**Design stories greatly influence task flows and as such, I was now ready to move onto building out how the user (Alee) would go from logging into Pinterest to filtering her main feed. {{% figure src="/images/TaskFlow.jpg" %}}**Wire Frames**Wire frames are when the theoretical come to life. They're an exciting part of the design process because they're your first taste at interaction. 

I created my wireframes based on my task flow and design stories. During this process, I continuously referenced the task flow to ensure that every action was represented.
