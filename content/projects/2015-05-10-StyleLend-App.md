When I moved to San Francisco, I did so with half a closet. Mainly because I moved into an apartment with a closet the size of a hamster. It was great for simplifying but I often found myself without the right outfit for the right occasion. Enter <a href="http://https://www.renttherunway.com/" target=_blank">Rent the Runway</a>, a platform for renting designer dresses for any occasion-- from date night to weddings. 

**Inspiration**

I used Rent the Runway many times until I heard about <a href="https://www.stylelend.com/" target=_blank">Style Lend</a>, a startup with a similar concept except hyper local. I’ve used Style Lend a few times and while I enjoyed the experience, I wished for an app to make the rental process even faster and more streamlined. So, I decided to create an iOS app.* 

**Persona**

I began by thinking about the user: 

Julie is 28, lives in Soma and attends special events (like a cocktail party or wedding) once a month. Her closet space is sparse and she loves a good deal. She likes that Style Lend is less expensive than Rent the Runway and local, so she can rent a dress the day before an event. 

Julie sometimes makes purchases on mobile. She would make purchases more often but will turn to desktop if the checkout process requires numerous fields. 

**App Flow**

Let’s begin with the first screens. After signing in, Julie can choose from curated (seasonal) collections and browse dresses.

She can favorite dresses to view later or continue shopping.

It was important to me to add multiple dress views and the ability to view dress details on one screen. 

Next, Julie can customize her rental, a feature that I wanted to make was available at any point during the process.

When it came to designing the checkout process, I kept things very simple.

Unnecessary information (email, phone number) is not needed during this process- those are pieces of information that can be garnered from account settings. Instead, I focused on including only the necessary pieces of information to create a checkout process that is no more than two screens.

Once Julie has rented her dress, she can immediately track the order or edit it once again (perhaps she changes her mind).

When Julie opens the app back up, a status message tells her where her dress is. If she clicks on the chevron on the top righthand corner, it will take her to a deep link that tracks her dress delivery. 

**Summary**

My goal for this app was to create a simple, clean, fashion-forward experience that enables users to browse and rent dresses on their phone. By focusing on only the necessary bits of information, I aimed to create an experience that users could follow through quickly and joyfully. After all, Style Lend is all about providing the perfect outfit. That certainly calls for a joyful app. 

Here's a video showing the interaction.

*Style Lend is launching their iOS app on May 11th, 2015. I created this app prior to Style Lend's launch.
 
*I do not work for Style Lend. I just really love their platform.*
