<a href: "/http://spotonparking.com/" target=_blank">SpotOn</a> is a new startup that helps marry frustrated drivers looking for parking with people who have driveways not always. Example: I only use my driveway in the evenings. With SpotOn, I can list the spot and rent it out for X amount of money hourly or monthly. If I'm a driver and have been searching for parking for the past hour, I can see an available spot near me thanks to SpotOn. 

If you live in San Francisco (or any big city) you can imagine how a service like this could be a lifesaver for city dwellers.  

**Opportunity**

SpotOn has two site experiences: Listers & Parkers. They wanted to tackle the Listers side first. 
They built a prototype and wanted to validate the design before shipping. Tradecraft came onboard to help.

**Process**

After getting to know the SpotOn product and design 
stories, we created a usability guide and performed usability tests with users fitting the SpotOn persona.  This involved taking them through a predetermined 
list of tasks and observing their reaction to and interactions for each task. We then analyzed the user 
tests, noting patterns and pain points. We categorized each issue as one of discoverability, 
information input/editing, user orientation or feedback. Based upon this matrix, we created design 
recommendations, quick wins and recommended next steps for SpotOn Parking. 

**Pain Points**

We analyzed the user tests, noting patterns and pain points. Each issue can be categorized as one of discoverability, information input/editing, user orientation or feedback.

*Lister's Registration Page Pain Points*

Once a user decides they want to list a spot, they have to create a profile. Here's what our usability test showed users thought of the process.

<div class="image-caption">Users can easily block off dates for spot availability.</div>

**Conclusion & Next Steps**

Our analysis found that most issues lie within the ‘Listers Registration’ page. We recommended a new form that will help users more easily navigate this page.

Beyond this recommendation, SpotOn also implemented our recommendations for quick wins.
