+++

<a href: "/http://spotonparking.com/" target=_blank">SpotOn</a> is a new startup that helps marry frustrated drivers looking for parking with people who have driveways not always. Example: I only use my driveway in the evenings. With SpotOn, I can list the spot and rent it out for X amount of money hourly or monthly. If I'm a driver and have been searching for parking for the past hour, I can see an available spot near me thanks to SpotOn. 

SpotOn has two site experiences: Listers & Parkers. 
In <a href: "/http://www.paigebennett.com/projects/SpotOn" target=_blank">Part 1</a>, I shared how we helped SpotOn redesign the  listers site. Now, I'll show you how we redesigned the parkers site.
