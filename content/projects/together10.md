<a href: "http://together10.com/" target="_blank">Together10</a> is a beta site that sends parents daily, quick lessons to explore with their children. It's a service created with the busy parent in mind. Each lesson takes 10 minutes or less to complete and is designed around what Together10 calls the "Together10 Advantage."

**Opportunity**

Together10 wanted to test the messaging clarity of its site before launching out of beta. They turned to Tradecraft for help creating a usability guide to test user experience and recommendations on redesign and A/B testing. 

**Process**

After getting to know the product, we designed and conducted tests with users that fit the Together10 profile (busy, working parents). We focused the usability test on Together10's homepage. After analyzing the tests, noting patterns and pain points, we created design recommendations for A/B testing and next steps for Together10.

**Feedback & Pain Points**

Here are some of the insides we received from the usability tests.

<div class="image-caption">Some users were confused by the phone and thought Together10 was an app (it's not- yet)</div>

<a href="/images/Feedback2.png" data-lightbox="persona" data-title="Feedback"><img src="/images/Feedback2.png"/></a>
<div class="image-caption">As users scroll down the page, their confusion over Together10's purpose was reflected most in this section.</div>

**Design Recommendations**

*Longterm Change*

Our longterm option is an overall restructuring of the homepage. 

<a href="/images/Together10Wireframe.png" data-lightbox="persona" data-title="Feedback"><img src="/images/Together10Wireframe.png"/></a>
<div class="image-caption"></div>

This redesign addresses user feedback and is aimed at clarifying how Together10 works.  

- Highlights a clear value statement below the call to action [“Sign Up”].

- Includes testimonies from users to reiterate quality.

- Includes a video showcasing how Together10 works. 

- Tabs convey their purpose more clearly.
 
- "Log In" to create a profile and connect with the community. 

*Quick Wins*

Of course, most startups don't have the time or resources to do a complete redesign. As a second option (one that could be shipped quickly), we recommended the following small changes. 

<a href="/images/QuickWin1.png" data-lightbox="persona" data-title="Quick Wins"><img src="/images/QuickWin1.png"/></a>
<div class="image-caption"></div>

<a href="/images/QuickWin2.png" data-lightbox="persona" data-title="Quick Wins"><img src="/images/QuickWin2.png"/></a>
<div class="image-caption"></div>

<a href="/images/QuickWin3.png" data-lightbox="persona" data-title="Quick Wins"><img src="/images/QuickWin3.png"/></a>
<div class="image-caption"></div>

**Conculusions & Next Steps**

We recommended that Together10 implement our designs and run an A/B test via Optimizely. After analyzing results from an A/B test, we also recommended that they establish a brand identity and language that carries throughout the Together10 page. 

Together10 will be implementing these changes in the coming weeks and we will be designing an onboarding experience based on feedback.
