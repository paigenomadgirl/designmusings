            <p>Together10 is a beta site that sends parents daily, quick lessons to explore with their children. It&rsquo;s a service created with the busy parent in mind. Each lesson takes 10 minutes or less to complete and is designed around what Together10 calls the &ldquo;Together10 Advantage.&rdquo; Opportunity Together10 wanted to test the messaging clarity of its site before launching out of beta. They turned to Tradecraft for help creating a usability guide to test user experience and recommendations on redesign and A/B testing.</p>

            <p>SpotOn is a new startup that helps marry frustrated drivers looking for parking with people who have driveways not always. Example: I only use my driveway in the evenings. With SpotOn, I can list the spot and rent it out for X amount of money hourly or monthly. If I&rsquo;m a driver and have been searching for parking for the past hour, I can see an available spot near me thanks to SpotOn.</p>

            <p>Success isn’t guaranteed but failure is certain if you aren’t emotionally invested in your work. -Biz, Things A Little Bird Told Me Each week, Tradecraft welcomes experts and inspiring entrepreneurs to share their insights with us during what we call a “Tradecraft teach.” A couple of weeks ago, I was elated to moderate a talk with Biz Stone. If you’re not familiar with Biz, he’s the co-founder of Twitter and Jelly, which recently released a fun new app called Super.</p>

            <p>I am a coder. It sounds weird to see that written out. Maybe that’s because it’s a rather new adventure in my life. Or maybe it’s because for years, I saw coding as swathed in a veil of mystery. Websites and apps just happened. Sure, there was someone on the other side making it happen but for the most part, it just seemed like magic. I am not a good coder (yet).</p>

            <p>As a UX Designer, it&rsquo;s part of the job to look for inspiration. I hope I&rsquo;ll always be constantly inspired by the world around me and the brilliant work of talented artists and designers. In that spirit, I&rsquo;d like to share my &lsquo;Inspiration Notebook&rsquo; with you. This is compiled of different images of UIs that inspire me. For example, I love Pinterest&rsquo;s board display. The simple and elegant way my pictures are displayed convey a warm yet not overly-fussy tone.</p>

            <p>What if paying for your meal could be effortless, fluid and simple? Just one click on your phone and boom — bill paid, out the door and onto the next adventure. This was the question that OpenTable’s design team dived into. The end result of their discovery is a feature that allows you to view and pay your check through the OpenTable app. Recently, Seth Andrezejewski, a User Experience Researcher for OpenTable, spoke at Tradecraft and shared a glimpse into the journey his team took to create this new feature.</p>

            <p>Drawing has always been a bit intimidating to me. I can see an idea or concept in my head but when it comes to putting pen to paper and communicating it visually, I would freeze up. So when we were given the assignment (challenge?) to draw 100 sketches in 2 days, I was nervous. So nervous. But, I love observing and people watching, which is an integral part of sketching. A Few of My Sketches.</p>
