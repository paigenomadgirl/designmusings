        <section>
            <p><em>Success isn’t guaranteed but failure is certain if you aren’t emotionally invested in your work. -Biz, Things A Little Bird Told Me</em></p>

<p>Each week, Tradecraft welcomes experts and inspiring entrepreneurs to share their insights with us during what we call a “Tradecraft teach.” A couple of weeks ago, I was elated to moderate a talk with Biz Stone.</p>

<p>If you’re not familiar with Biz, he’s the co-founder of Twitter and Jelly, which recently released a fun new app called <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/17/biz-stone-super/" target="_blank">Super</a>. What I find inspiring about Biz’s journey to tech and ultimate success is how optimistic his philosophy on career has remained.</p>

<p>As a fellow optimist, it’s refreshing to meet a leader that is unapologetically empathetic and positive. It’s this outlook that promoted me to invite Biz to Tradecraft, knowing that what he had to share would particularly resonate in a room full of driven people looking to change a little bit of the world.</p>

<p>At Tradecraft, we say that we’re like chefs in a kitchen, responsible for creating our own our success. Or as Biz puts it, “opportunity is manufactured.”</p>

<p><em>If something’s fun, a lot of people will use it. If a lot of people use it, then it can be important. -Biz</em></p>

<p>One of the most impactful things Biz shared was on the subject of fun. As a designer, I want to create products that bring users joy. Beauty, simplicity and refreshment are all things I hope users would find within the products I build but Biz reminded me that fun should be touted right along with these attributes. There is an importance to having fun — both in the creation of your product and in the product’s function.</p>

<p>If you’ve played around with Super, you’ll notice that it’s primary function isn’t serious — it’s just fun. When it launched, someone wrote that the app looked like the offspring of Andy Warhol and Dr. Seuss. It’s true. Super is delightfully different.</p>

<p>And perhaps that’s the key to creating things that resonate with users. Don’t worry about what everyone else is creating. Be fun, be creative and love what you build.</p>

<p>What Biz reiterates, to have fun and build things you genuinely like, is of course sometimes easier said than done but it’s a challenge that should be worth pursuing.</p>

<p>We enter Tradecraft because we want to change things and create companies, products and features that really make a difference to people. In the journey of ever “disrupting” an industry to create change, it’s important to not lose sight of your passion — for the product and the people you are creating it for. And to make the things you build actually fun to use. I think Biz would agree.</p>
