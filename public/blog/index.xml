      <title>Vint: A Usability Study</title>
      <link>http://paigebennett.com/blog/vint/</link>

      <guid>http://paigebennett.com/blog/vint/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My wedding is 4 months away, about the time when brides start panicking about things like invitations, caterers and the fit of their wedding dress. Me, I’m more concerned about the last issue&amp;ndash; my wedding dress (and fitting nicely into it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That concern is largely want made new fitness app Vint catch my eye last week. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.joinvint.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Vint&lt;/a&gt; touts itself as a “peer to peer fitness marketplace.” I was drawn to the app because of the ability to book a personal trainer in my area for less than what I would have to pay for in a gym. Since my exercise choices are largely based on time (early mornings) and location, I was excited about Vint and what it could do to help me reach my wedding fitness goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now to be honest, my first few interactions with the app were a bit frustrating. It took me several attempts to find and successfully book a trainer. So in the vein of improvement (and because I want Vint to succeed), I decided to focus a guerrilla usability study on this app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Platform&lt;/strong&gt;: Android HTC&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem&lt;/strong&gt;: I use Vint to locate and book personal trainers in my area for early morning training sessions. I’ve had some trouble successfully finding and booking a trainer and wanted to test and see if other people had the same issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Users&lt;/strong&gt;: I targeted my local Laundromat (captive audience), my Lyft driver Paul and the nice people at Workshop Café. In total, I interviewed 6 people and recorded my time with them. You can view the videos &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qxuw8nq9v6cabq9/AACWB_ikpNnqZ83eI9rFUn3Wa?dl=0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;/images/Cafe.jpg&#34;  /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began by asking them the following filter questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ve been given $500 for a personal trainer. How would you go about finding one?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you used a personal trainer?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do you look for in a personal trainer? Tell me about price, type and location.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What was the process of finding a personal trainer process like?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you haven’t used a personal trainer, are you interested in getting one?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell me about why you haven’t used a personal trainer before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tasks&lt;/strong&gt;: I then asked users to complete 4 common tasks that I do most often within the app:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find an instructor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Book a session&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Request a new session time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cancel a session&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;: While every user experienced some specific difficulty with the app, there were 3 pain points that stood out as causing users the most frustration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;/images/Painpoints.jpg&#34;  /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pain Point #1: Canceling a Session&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I don’t know, I really don’t know.” –Paul&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a pain point that I am intimately familiar with. The first time I used Vint, I accidentally booked a session and could not find how to cancel it. As I found from talking to users, I am not the only one who had trouble with this task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To cancel a session, you must visit your profile page to view and cancel your bookings. Two of the users gave up during this task, not ever making it to the profile page and sharing with me that they would contact the trainer directly to cancel. Two other users gave up on the task and said that it was &amp;ldquo;just not possible to cancel a session.&amp;rdquo; Only one user was able to find and cancel a session without visiting other pages first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I’d rather something be in this first page than have to go back to my profile.” –Lisa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;: One of my users referenced what she called her favorite app- Urban Sitter. She said she would have liked to see Vint display recent bookings (with a cancel option) on the main page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used Urban Sitter as my inspiration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;/images/baby.jpg&#34;  /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;/images/CurrentCancel.png&#34;  /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;/images/Cancel.jpg&#34;  /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(One fun bug we found was with the booking procces itself. After booking, error message would pop up saying that the booking was not successful. This caused users to try a second time, which produced no error message. Even though they received an error message, the first booking had gone through, which means users were stuck with two bookings. I&amp;rsquo;ve contacted Vint and they&amp;rsquo;ve since fixed the bug.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pain Point #2: Hard to notice categorization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It’s not giving me a lot of information.” –Oscar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of the users I spoke with noticed the exercise categories, dates and times at the bottom of each instructors picture on the main page. Three users remarked how they wished there were categories but none noticed the categorization that was present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;/images/CurrentCategory.jpg&#34;  /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;/images/Recommended.jpg&#34;  /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pain Point #3: Confusing Function of the Vint Logo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I think this app is very poorly designed.” –Lisa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users would click on the Vint logo expecting it to take them back a page. Instead, the logo took them to the main page. Once in the main page, clicking on the logo would exit users out of the app. Get rid of the Vint logo after the homepage. It’s not needed because you know what app you are in. Instead, include the back arrow to show users how to go back in a page. (leaning on material design). They couldn’t see the back button because the logo asset is too big.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;/images/Category.jpg&#34;  /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you compare the Vint logo to another app&amp;rsquo;s logo (in this case, Gmail), you can see that the Vint logo is larger. This might have added to the difficulty users had in noticing the back arrow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;/images/Logos.png&#34;  /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize that Vint&amp;rsquo;s design is in keeping with Andriod&amp;rsquo;s design principles but the logo isn&amp;rsquo;t needed- users know what app they&amp;rsquo;re in. Instead, I am leaning on material design and recommending that they remove the logo and increase the size of the back arrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;/images/AfterLogo.jpg&#34;  /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is similar to Airbnb&amp;rsquo;s app:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;/images/Airbnb.jpg&#34;  /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that when you click on the Vint logo while on the main page, it will exit you out of the app. This happened to every user I interviewed and their reaction was a mixture of surprise, confusion and dismay.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several other recommendations that I will be addressing in the near future. Like&amp;hellip;.onboarding! This wasn&amp;rsquo;t something I could complete within a short timeframe but designing an onboarding experience would solve several problems I noticed, including cancelation, confusing profiles and unclear categorization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like how Pinterest does onboarding and recommend that Vint create a similar experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;/images/Pinterest%201.jpg&#34;  /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;/images/Pinterest%204.jpg&#34;  /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This design is also a little less intensive to create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So stay tuned for Vint: Part deux (and updates on how that wedding dress fits).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I do not work for Vint and am not affiliated with them in any way. I do use the app and am passionate about providing delightful user experiences.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Elements of User Experience</title>
      <link>http://paigebennett.com/blog/third/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2014 16:17:54 PST</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://paigebennett.com/blog/third/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In some ways, Jesse James Garrett introduced me into the (official) world of User Experience.
His book, the &lt;em&gt;Elements of User Experience&lt;/em&gt;, was the first work on UX that I read. As such, I appreciated the simple, clear and relatable language that Garrett used to introduce newbies like me to the UX world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Garrett described user experience as “the experience the product creates for the people who use it in the real world.” Sometimes we have great experiences with products (I’m looking at you, nostalgic Timehop), other times the experience is frustrating (like anytime I try to navigate Netflix on my tv). Our jobs as designers are to make that experience one of joy, delight and ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are many things that Garrett’s book helped me understand better, I’ll share with you my top highlights:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Five Planes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Garrett describes the five planes as layers that build upon one another and influence how a site looks and behaves. His five planes are: Surface, Skeleton, Structure, Scope and Strategy. What I loved about this is how it broke down a site into the many, many different facets, from abstract (strategy) to concrete (surface). Garrett emphasized the importance of each plane’s dependence on the other. For example, if you miss getting the strategy right, it will affect the scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Plane Approach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While each plane is dependent on one another, that doesn’t mean that you have to finish each plane before you can start work on the next section. That could lead to frustration for everyone involved. Instead, Garrett provided a straight-forward, great piece of advice to keep in mind: “have work on each plane &lt;strong&gt;finish&lt;/strong&gt; before work on the next can finish.” I appreciated this clarification because I have been a part of teams before that have tried to finish one plane before starting another. It did lead to frustration- both from the team and our users. Had we taken Garrett’s advice, perhaps we would have all been better off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Understand the consequences of your solution to the problem.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was one of the most influential statements that Garrett made and I hope that it’s one I will always keep top of mind. Sometimes we can be so focused on fixing the problem that we don’t take a step back to consider how that solution could possibly cause a ripple effect throughout the design. It takes your team thinking about each plane to avoid this. Garrett provided this helpful diagram to show what this might look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;/images/third_diagram.png&#34;  /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Diagram&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you approach your product development process with the complete user experience in mind, you can come out of it with a product that’s an asset, not a liability.” Yes, Mr. Garrett. Yes indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My First User Study (The Shaky, Grass Roots Edition) </title>
      <link>http://paigebennett.com/blog/second/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2014 13:58:43 PST</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://paigebennett.com/blog/second/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things I’m most excited about at Tradecraft is getting the opportunity to study and implement user studies following the lean startup philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Laura Klein’s book UX for Lean Startups, “Lean UX is solidly data driven.” In other words, you test first, assume never.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should set the stage now and share with you that up to this point, my experience with user studies have been purely grassroots. Really grassroots. But, since my goal for this blog is to be one that highlights (hopefully) progress, let me introduce you to User Study #1: The Grassroots Edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right off the bat, I can tell you how we wrongly went about this study: we didn’t first form a hypothesis that we were trying to answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what we assumed: our website messaging wasn’t clear, the website flow made no sense and our checkout system was confusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically we went into the user study looking for validation for what we wanted to do, which was completely rework the website and messaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined the startup after the website had launched but I wished this study had been done prior to launching the site. Again, that’s where the lean startup school of thought makes so much sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started by interviewing 16 people, all non-users of our product. With the exception of 4, they had never heard of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had them walk through our booking process, from the homepage to choosing a product they were interested in, booking and reserving that product. Finally, we asked them about a couple of specific pages we felt were lacking in clarity and flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“$60 is too much. What am I getting for that?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Validation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The user study validated a lot of what we already knew, like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Messaging: It wasn’t clear to the user what exactly we were offering or where they could have the meal. Would the chef come to their house? Was it at the chef’s house? Was it delivery? The user really didn’t know.
Dynamic Pricing: The need for pricing that changed depending on how many people you have at a dinner. The price displayed isn’t what you would pay if there was only 2 people&amp;hellip;or a larger group like 15. Users were unaware that booking a dinner under the minimum number of people shown would result in a higher price per person.
Flow: From the homepage to the meals page, filtering down to what you wanted to see (cooking classes, meals, tours) wasn’t intuitive. Part of that stemmed from hazy messaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I thought you served only Italian food.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Insights:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also got a lot of great feedback on issues we didn’t know were issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consistent Images: One thing we heard was about our H1 image on our homepage. It conveyed (to a couple of users) that we offered one genre of food. Of course, there’s no way a picture of food will convey every genre but still, this was interesting feedback. If only to reiterate how important visuals are to our site.
Menu Clarity: We have pictures of food and a menu listed on the meals page but you’ll notice they’re not listed side-by-side. We heard from some users that this added to their confusion, especially when the menu featured food they were unfamiliar with.
Social Trust: We offer Facebook login but not using the Facebook symbol (it simply says “Login”). The study showed us that users wanted to see the Facebook symbol. To them, it added validity and trust.
Next Steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The raw feedback was enlightening enough but when it came to actionable items to provide backend, we focused on three areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Messaging on the home and meals pages&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dynamic pricing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How it Works&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Our reasoning for putting How it Works as a high priority was because of heavy site traffic to that page.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to share the before and after images but my path took a quick turn while in the middle of this study. Instead, I handed it over to my very capable coworkers and look forward to seeing the end result as a user.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Journey From Journalism to Design</title>
      <link>http://paigebennett.com/blog/first/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2014 13:42:29 PST</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://paigebennett.com/blog/first/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the days before iPhones and internet, while other kids were playing teacher or house, I was reading the newspaper into a tape recorder, “anchoring” my own tv news show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the time I was young, I knew what I wanted to be when I grew up. It never wavered or changed, like other things in my life (such as that dark period before I loved avocados or when I hated wine), I never second guessed this dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter college. No major change, no shift, no worries. Print journalism was dying and I was told that the probability of anchoring in a large market was small. Still, that didn’t deter me. There was something about communication- pure and simple with your audience- that was innate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But things changed and sands shifted. Like many journalists, the allure of PR drew me in. It was a semi-regular schedule, semi-regular hours and more pay that my measly producer salary drew. And though I didn’t love it, it taught me well. Through PR, I was introduced to tech. I was still a storyteller and (in theory) the audience was still my main priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found, though, that I increasingly wanted to connect with a brand’s audience in a deeper way- to help build the trust and customer experience. Essentially, I wanted to manage the community. And so, earlier this summer, I jumped at a chance to direct the community for an early stage startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was lean&amp;hellip;.incredibly so. But almost immediately after accepting, my role shifted completely. And while that’s to be expected to a certain point in the startup world, it became something that I didn’t recognize for a vision I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand. But nonetheless, there were opportunities to learn everyday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were building everything on our own. The messaging, the voice, the experience. It was all on us. And these things I loved. I loved conducting a grassroots study to figure out how people perceive us and our website. I loved figuring out what people liked and what they hated and why. I don’t think I realized I was doing user experience. But what I realized is that I really, really liked it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so a few weeks ago, when I received word that funding wasn’t going as expected and that wasn’t any money to pay me…well, I guess you could say that it was my first taste of the not so glamorous world of startups. They’re not all the 1% success stories. Some crash and burn. And while it hurts, it can also be a chance for a new chapter (&amp;ldquo;One door closes&amp;rdquo; and all that jazz….).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So on November 24th, I began a new journey, studying UX at Tradecraft, under the visionary Kate Rutter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a way, my childhood passion has come full circle. When I was a journalist, the audience was my main focus. It mattered most that I understood my audience and how to communicate with them.  In critical times, if I did not understand them, I would fail  as a communicator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The audience- the user- will continue to be my main focus. I have a lot to learn but between you and me, I haven’t been this excited since I was a kid, reading articles from the Picayune Item into my tape recorder. So raise your glass with me. Here&amp;rsquo;s to a new journey.&lt;/p&gt;
