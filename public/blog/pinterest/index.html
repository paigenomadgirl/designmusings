            <p><a href="http://www.pinterest.com" target="_blank">Pinterest</a> is a website and mobile app that allows users to create visual bookmarks of everything ranging from meals to wedding inspiration to home decor. After launching in the first prototype in 2010, Pinterest has become so popular that &ldquo;pinning&rdquo; something is now woven into modern lexicon. But sometimes it can be hard to filter through pins on your main feed and find content that you&rsquo;re truly interested in.</p>

<p>You currate your main feed by following pinners you like. Currently, there is no way to currate your main feed further by searching and displaying a certain cateogory from the pins of people you follow. Instead, Pinterest pulls in all pins from their entire network.</p>

<p>For example, you cannot filter your main feed to display only home decor-related pins from your pinners.</p>

<p>As a solution, I created a filter feature that allows you to filter your main feed by category.</p>

<p>To give you a better idea, here&rsquo;s a video of the prototype I created.
<iframe width="560" height="420" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/o3G0VbCgDjo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>

<p>The purpose of the filter button is to display content within a set of specific criteria. This feature will shape the content you see into pins that are most helpful to you. Say you are looking for inspiration for home decor. You may now find inspiration faster because your main feed has become more dynamic and impactful through being able to filter the pins you are seeing.</p>

<p>In order to create this feature, I first began with a persona: hard-working mom Alee. She&rsquo;s a busy stay-at-home mom with an 8 month old baby and is redecorating her home room by room.</p>

<p>Alee loves DIY projects and turns to Pinterest for inspiration. She curates the content on her Pinterest feed by following &ldquo;pinners&rdquo; that reflect a similar style as Alee&rsquo;s. Even so, her main feed is a mixture of pins ranging from various categories. This is not always helpful, especially when Alee scrolls through her main feed while on mobile.</p>

<p>Alee wants to be able to see specific categories of pins that pinners she follows have shared. With this function, Alee can take her curated content and curate it further, creating a main feed that features only those categories she&rsquo;s interested in.</p>

<p><a href="/images/AleePersona.jpg" data-lightbox="persona" data-title="Alee Persona"><img src="/images/AleePersona.jpg"/></a></p>

<p><strong>Process</strong></p>

<p>After rounding out my persona to include richer behavioral and needs insights, I created the design stories and task flows. This influenced the wire frames and prototype that I was then able to create. Let&rsquo;s take a look at these different components.</p>

<p><strong>Design Stories</strong></p>

<p>This feature will allow Alee to:</p>

<ul>
<li>filter her feed by category</li>
<li>select a category to view</li>
<li>view her main feed based on a preset category</li>
<li>add a filter to her feed</li>
<li>remove a filter from her feed</li>
<li>find a pin based on her category preference</li>
<li>(and with much more ease), &ldquo;Heart&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;Pin&rdquo; a pin she likes</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Task Flow</strong></p>

<p>Alee&rsquo;s motive for using Pinterest is to reference pins she likes. I decided that she would most likely either &ldquo;heart&rdquo; a pin or &ldquo;pin&rdquo; a pin to one of her DIY boards. Thus, my task flow shows her journey with Pinterest ending in either of these two actions.</p>

<p><strong>UI Sketches</strong></p>

<p><a href="/images/WireFrames.jpg" data-lightbox="wireFrames" data-title="WireFrames"><img src="/images/WireFrames.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>One thing I learned during this part of the process was that the categories needed to be a pop up box, as opposed to a separate window. Sketching out 6 different ways to display categories helped clarify that this was the more effective route.</p>

<p><strong>Wireframes (and a few fun surprises)</strong></p>

<p>After creating my wireframes, I did a short usability study with a few people and noticed something immediately: the filter button was confusing.
I had used the filter icon that&rsquo;s part of Andriod design convention. However, the feedback I received was that users thought the button was meant to sort content&hellip;.not choose a category. Uh oh!</p>

<p><a href="/images/FilterExample.jpg" data-lightbox="filter-example" data-title="Filter Example"><img src="/images/FilterExample.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>At first, I thought to use the same categories icon that Pinterest has on its site. However, this icon on mobile can be confusing. After looking at how other Android apps displayed their filter button, I used Fitmob as inspiration.</p>

<p><a href="/images/FitmobExample.png" data-lightbox="fitmob-example" data-title="Fitmob Example"><img src="/images/FitmobExample.png"/></a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s simple and direct. There&rsquo;s no doubting what this button does.</p>

<p>My wireframes will help explain:</p>

<p><a href="/images/Wireframes 1.jpg" data-lightbox="wireframes-group" data-title="Wireframe 1"><img src="/images/Wireframes 1.jpg"/></a></p>

<p><a href="/images/Wireframes 2.jpg" data-lightbox="wireframes-group" data-title="Wireframe 2"><img src="/images/Wireframes 2.jpg"/></a></p>

<p><a href="/images/Wireframes 3.jpg" data-lightbox="wireframes-group" data-title="Wireframe 3"><img src="/images/Wireframes 3.jpg"/></a></p>

<p><a href="/images/Wireframes 4.jpg" data-lightbox="wireframes-group" data-title="Wireframe 4"><img src="/images/Wireframes 4.jpg"/></a></p>

<p><strong>Prototype</strong></p>

<p>My prototype will help give you a taste at how this feature would work.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="420" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/o3G0VbCgDjo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of how this feature might look on the app.</p>

<p><a href="/images/HighFidelity.jpg" data-lightbox="high-fidelity" data-title="High Fidelity"><img src="/images/HighFidelity.jpg"/></a></p>

<p><strong>Learnings &amp; Next Steps</strong></p>

<p>As I worked through the process of creating this feature, I learned that the most obvious answer isn&rsquo;t always the best one (see the filter icon dilemma above). Like <a href="https://twitter.com/jjg/"target="_blank">Jesse James Garrett</a> cautions in his book <em>The Elements of User Experience</em>, my filter feature does create a few edge cases.</p>

<p>For example: lets say Alee chooses the Cars &amp; Motorcycles category and none of the pinners she follows have users this category of content. What message would she see? Or while Pinterest has &lsquo;Recent Categories,&rsquo; would it be of value to also include the ability to preset a list of categories?</p>

<p>These are both questions that have cropped up <em>because</em> of my feature. My next steps would include working through these edge cases and creating the best solution.</p>

<p>I am also not convinced that the current filter button is the best way to represent the button&rsquo;s functionality. There could be other icons that also communicate the intent, while staying in line with the Pinterest look and feel. I would want to explore this further.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>While the filter button helps users curate their content, I believe that there&rsquo;s much more to explore. This one feature only scratched the surface. So stay tuned for more. This story is certainly not over.</p>
