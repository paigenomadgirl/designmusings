            <p>Drawing has always been a bit intimidating to me. I can see an idea or concept in my head but when it comes to putting pen to paper and communicating it visually, I would freeze up.</p>

<p>So when we were given the assignment (challenge?) to draw 100 sketches in 2 days, I was nervous. So nervous. But, I love observing and people watching, which is an integral part of sketching.</p>

<p>Over the past few days, I’ve opened my eyes to lines, shapes and flows. I’ve found more grace with my drawing ability.</p>

<p>We were given exactly 100 cards, so if I mess up, I push on rather than trash the card and start over. It was surprisingly freeing.</p>

<p>People were the biggest challenge for me but I learned to focus more on their shapes than details.</p>

<p>The more I sketched, the easier it became to do this- especially helpful when I tried to sketch movement.</p>

<p>Sketching a space from above proved to be an interesting challenge and it made me consider space between objects more closely. (It also inspired me to rearrange my furniture.)</p>

<p>As hesitant as I felt on Monday about sketching, I really enjoyed this assignment. It gave me a little more confidence in drawing and helped me to see the space around me in a different light.</p>
