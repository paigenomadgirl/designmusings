            <p>Drawing has always been a bit intimidating to me. I can see an idea or concept in my head but when it comes to putting pen to paper and communicating it visually, I would freeze up.</p>

<p>So when we were given the assignment (challenge?) to draw 100 sketches in 2 days, I was nervous. So nervous. But, I love observing and people watching, which is an integral part of sketching.</p>

<p><a href="/images/Allpictures.jpg" data-lightbox="persona" data-title="A Few of My Sketches"><img src="/images/Allpictures.jpg"/></a>
<div class="image-caption">A Few of My Sketches.</div></p>

<p>Over the past few days, I’ve opened my eyes to lines, shapes and flows. I’ve found more grace with my drawing ability.</p>

<p><a href="/images/Thing.jpg" data-lightbox="persona" data-title="Things. All found in my house."><img src="/images/Things.jpg"/></a>
<div class="image-caption">Things. All found in my house.</div></p>

<p>We were given exactly 100 cards, so if I mess up, I push on rather than trash the card and start over. It was surprisingly freeing.</p>

<p><a href="/images/Interaction.jpg" data-lightbox="persona" data-title="People. Ladies chat during lunch."><img src="/images/Interaction.jpg"/></a>
<div class="image-caption">People. Ladies chat during lunch.</div></p>

<p>People were the biggest challenge for me but I learned to focus more on their shapes than details.</p>

<p><a href="/images/Withlaptop.jpg" data-lightbox="persona" data-title="Context. I sketched many of my fellow Tradecrafters interacting with their phones and computers."><img src="/images/Withlaptop.jpg"/></a>
<div class="image-caption">Context. I sketched many of my fellow Tradecrafters interacting with their phones and computers.</div></p>

<p>The more I sketched, the easier it became to do this- especially helpful when I tried to sketch movement.</p>

<p><a href="/images/Motion.jpg" data-lightbox="persona" data-title="Flow. A lady pushing a stroller, a man running in the Embarcadero."><img src="/images/Motion.jpg"/></a>
<div class="image-caption">Flow. A lady pushing a stroller, a man running in the Embarcadero.</div></p>

<p>Sketching a space from above proved to be an interesting challenge and it made me consider space between objects more closely. (It also inspired me to rearrange my furniture.)</p>

<p><a href="/images/Space.jpg" data-lightbox="persona" data-title="Space. Aerial views of my bedroom & living room."><img src="/images/Space.jpg"/></a>
<div class="image-caption">Space. Aerial view of my bedroom &amp; living room.</div></p>

<p>As hesitant as I felt on Monday about sketching, I really enjoyed this assignment. It gave me a little more confidence in drawing and helped me to see the space around me in a different light.</p>
