        <section style="margin-top: 30px;">
            <p>For a few years, I lived and worked in the Middle East, developing a user strategy for a small startup. Much of my job was to study how cultural beliefs impact business decision-making and public speaking.</p>

<p><img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="/images/whereilived.png" alt="">
<div class="image-caption">Here&rsquo;s where I lived! The lovely city of Muscat in Oman.</div></p>

<p>It was a fascinating time and shaped much of my understanding of how culture impacts how you use and interpret technology.</p>

<p><strong>Entering the Desert</strong></p>

<p>When I first moved to Oman (this little jewel of a country), the startup I worked for was still in beta. They had an idea but no real idea of if it would work. More importantly, there wasn’t yet an understanding of if people even wanted what we had to offer.</p>

<p>Because we were entering a new landscape and vastly different culture, it was important for me to understand the cultural ties behind decision-making.</p>

<p>So the first thing I did? I sat in on business meetings.</p>

<p><strong>Business Later. Coffee Now.</strong></p>

<p>Here’s a tip: if you want to fail at doing business in the Middle East, rush into meetings and get down to business straight away.  The plucky expat who tries to talk about business immediately misses a very important aspect of the culture: trust.</p>

<p><img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="/images/what2.jpg" alt=""></p>

<div class="image-caption">Business meetings begin with asking about family and health. This is to establish/reiterate the need for trust of the individual (as family) in order to do business.</div>

<p>In my research I found that trust is garnered over family settings like breaking bread and drinking coffee. Business becomes more trusted only after the businessperson becomes like family.</p>

<p>It is not enough to trust the company. Trust begins first with the individual. Taking coffee is extending an olive branch.</p>

<p><strong>Honor &amp; Shame</strong></p>

<p>The honor/shame culture present in the Middle East is present in every facet of life, including business. My ethnographic studies found that the biggest way one could break the trust they’ve established in a business relationship is to bring shame upon someone.</p>

<p>I experienced this first-hand early on after scolding a client for sending a contract in late.  What was acceptable in American business could break relationships in Oman.</p>

<p>In Omani culture, problems are talked around versus talked about. This lessens the chance that someone might shame a business associate by pointing out conflict.</p>

<p><img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="/images/problems.jpg" alt="">
<div class="image-caption">The concept simplified.</div></p>

<p><strong>Creating The Persona</strong></p>

<p>After several weeks of research, it came time to create personas for the company we were building. Here’s one of the personas that I created:</p>

<p><img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="/images/Omanpersona.png" alt="">
<div class="image-caption">This is one of 10 personas created within the first few weeks of research.</div></p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Studying the Omani people helped me map and understand the complexities behind decision making in business and the people who would use our product. This in turn helped our company target the right group of people and create a product that they needed.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for Part 2 as I explain how I addressed usability studies in gender-conscious environments.</p>
