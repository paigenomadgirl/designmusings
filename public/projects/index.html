            <p>For a few years, I lived and worked in the Middle East, developing a user strategy for a small startup. Much of my job was to study how cultural beliefs impact business decision-making and public speaking. Here&rsquo;s where I lived! The lovely city of Muscat in Oman. It was a fascinating time and shaped much of my understanding of how culture impacts how you use and interpret technology. Entering the Desert When I first moved to Oman (this little jewel of a country), the startup I worked for was still in beta.</p>

            <p>San Francisco has a plethora of microclimates. On any given day, you could wakeup warm and sunny at home and work and arrive at work to be greeted by cold and fog. It’s just part of life in the Bay. So it can be frustrating to know how to dress among many different climates. After moving from Austin to San Francisco, I would joke with my fiancée that I didn’t know whether to wear tights, scarves or both each day.</p>

            <p>SpotOn is a new startup that helps marry frustrated drivers looking for parking with people who have driveways not always. Example: I only use my driveway in the evenings. With SpotOn, I can list the spot and rent it out for X amount of money hourly or monthly. If I&rsquo;m a driver and have been searching for parking for the past hour, I can see an available spot near me thanks to SpotOn.</p>

            <p>Together10 is a beta site that sends parents daily, quick lessons to explore with their children. It&rsquo;s a service created with the busy parent in mind. Each lesson takes 10 minutes or less to complete and is designed around what Together10 calls the &ldquo;Together10 Advantage.&rdquo; Opportunity Together10 wanted to test the messaging clarity of its site before launching out of beta. They turned to Tradecraft for help creating a usability guide to test user experience and recommendations on redesign and A/B testing.</p>

            <p>Pinterest is a website and mobile app that allows users to create visual bookmarks of everything ranging from meals to wedding inspiration to home decor. After launching in the first prototype in 2010, Pinterest has become so popular that &ldquo;pinning&rdquo; something is now woven into modern lexicon. But sometimes it can be hard to filter through pins on your main feed and find content that you&rsquo;re truly interested in. You currate your main feed by following pinners you like.</p>

            <p>My wedding is 4 months away, about the time when brides start panicking about things like invitations, caterers and the fit of their wedding dress. Me, I’m more concerned about the last issue&ndash; my wedding dress (and fitting nicely into it). That concern is largely want made new fitness app Vint catch my eye last week. Vint touts itself as a “peer to peer fitness marketplace.” I was drawn to the app because of the ability to book a personal trainer in my area for less than what I would have to pay for in a gym.</p>
