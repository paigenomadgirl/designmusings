      <title>Pinterest: Persona to Prototype</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pinterest.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Pinterest&lt;/a&gt; is a website and mobile app that allows users to create visual bookmarks of everything ranging from meals to wedding inspiration to home decor. After launching in the first prototype in 2010, Pinterest has become so popular that &amp;ldquo;pinning&amp;rdquo; something is now woven into modern lexicon. But sometimes it can be hard to filter through pins on your main feed and find content that you&amp;rsquo;re truly interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You currate your main feed by following pinners you like. Currently, there is no way to currate your main feed further by searching and displaying a certain cateogory from the pins of people you follow. Instead, Pinterest pulls in all pins from their entire network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, you cannot filter your main feed to display only home decor-related pins from your pinners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a solution, I created a filter feature that allows you to filter your main feed by category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give you a better idea, here&amp;rsquo;s a video of the prototype I created.
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;420&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/o3G0VbCgDjo&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the filter button is to display content within a set of specific criteria. This feature will shape the content you see into pins that are most helpful to you. Say you are looking for inspiration for home decor. You may now find inspiration faster because your main feed has become more dynamic and impactful through being able to filter the pins you are seeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to create this feature, I first began with a persona: hard-working mom Alee. She&amp;rsquo;s a busy stay-at-home mom with an 8 month old baby and is redecorating her home room by room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alee loves DIY projects and turns to Pinterest for inspiration. She curates the content on her Pinterest feed by following &amp;ldquo;pinners&amp;rdquo; that reflect a similar style as Alee&amp;rsquo;s. Even so, her main feed is a mixture of pins ranging from various categories. This is not always helpful, especially when Alee scrolls through her main feed while on mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alee wants to be able to see specific categories of pins that pinners she follows have shared. With this function, Alee can take her curated content and curate it further, creating a main feed that features only those categories she&amp;rsquo;s interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;/images/AleePersona.jpg&#34; data-lightbox=&#34;persona&#34; data-title=&#34;Alee Persona&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/AleePersona.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;image-caption&#34;&gt;Alee Persona&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After rounding out my persona to include richer behavioral and needs insights, I created the design stories and task flows. This influenced the wire frames and prototype that I was then able to create. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at these different components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feature will allow Alee to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;filter her feed by category&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;select a category to view&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;view her main feed based on a preset category&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add a filter to her feed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remove a filter from her feed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find a pin based on her category preference&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(and with much more ease), &amp;ldquo;Heart&amp;rdquo; and/or &amp;ldquo;Pin&amp;rdquo; a pin she likes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Task Flow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alee&amp;rsquo;s motive for using Pinterest is to reference pins she likes. I decided that she would most likely either &amp;ldquo;heart&amp;rdquo; a pin or &amp;ldquo;pin&amp;rdquo; a pin to one of her DIY boards. Thus, my task flow shows her journey with Pinterest ending in either of these two actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;/images/Pinterest Task Flow.jpg&#34; data-lightbox=&#34;task-flow&#34; data-title=&#34;Pinterest Task Flow&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/Pinterest Task Flow.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UI Sketches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;/images/UIsketches.jpg&#34; data-lightbox=&#34;wireFrames&#34; data-title=&#34;WireFrames&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/UIsketches.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I learned during this part of the process was that the categories needed to be a pop up box, as opposed to a separate window. Sketching out 6 different ways to display categories helped clarify that this was the more effective route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wireframes (and a few fun surprises)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After creating my wireframes, I did a short usability study with a few people and noticed something immediately: the filter button was confusing.
I had used the filter icon that&amp;rsquo;s part of Andriod design convention. However, the feedback I received was that users thought the button was meant to sort content&amp;hellip;.not choose a category. Uh oh!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;/images/filter.jpg&#34; data-lightbox=&#34;filter-example&#34; data-title=&#34;Filter Example&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/filter.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;image-caption&#34;&gt;Does this filter or sort?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, I thought to use the same categories icon that Pinterest has on its site. However, this icon on mobile can be confusing. After looking at how other Android apps displayed their filter button, I used Fitmob as inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;/images/fitmob.jpg&#34; data-lightbox=&#34;fitmob-example&#34; data-title=&#34;Fitmob Example&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/fitmob.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s simple and direct. There&amp;rsquo;s no doubting what this button does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wireframes will help explain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;/images/Wireframes 1.jpg&#34; data-lightbox=&#34;wireframes-group&#34; data-title=&#34;Wireframe 1&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/Wireframes 1.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;/images/Updatedwireframe.jpg&#34; data-lightbox=&#34;wireframes-group&#34; data-title=&#34;Wireframe 2&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/Updatedwireframe.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;/images/Wireframes 4.jpg&#34; data-lightbox=&#34;wireframes-group&#34; data-title=&#34;Wireframe 4&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/Wireframes 4.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prototype&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My prototype will help give you a taste at how this feature would work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;420&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/o3G0VbCgDjo&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learnings &amp;amp; Next Steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I worked through the process of creating this feature, I learned that the most obvious answer isn&amp;rsquo;t always the best one (see the filter icon dilemma above). Like &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jjg/&#34;target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Jesse James Garrett&lt;/a&gt; cautions in his book &lt;em&gt;The Elements of User Experience&lt;/em&gt;, my filter feature does create a few edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example: lets say Alee chooses the Cars &amp;amp; Motorcycles category and none of the pinners she follows have users this category of content. What message would she see? Or while Pinterest has &amp;lsquo;Recent Categories,&amp;rsquo; would it be of value to also include the ability to preset a list of categories?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are both questions that have cropped up &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; of my feature. My next steps would include working through these edge cases and creating the best solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also not convinced that the current filter button is the best way to represent the button&amp;rsquo;s functionality. There could be other icons that also communicate the intent, while staying in line with the Pinterest look and feel. I would want to explore this further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the filter button helps users curate their content, I believe that there&amp;rsquo;s much more to explore. This one feature only scratched the surface. So stay tuned for more. This story is certainly not over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions or feedback? Reach out to me: &lt;a href=&#34;https://paige@tradecrafted.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;paige@tradecrafted.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I do not work for Pinterest. I just love the app and owe most of my homemade dinners to Pinterest inspiration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Vint: A Usability Study</title>
      <link>http://paigebennett.com/projects/vint/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2014 19:29:32 PST</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://paigebennett.com/projects/vint/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My wedding is 4 months away, about the time when brides start panicking about things like invitations, caterers and the fit of their wedding dress. Me, I’m more concerned about the last issue&amp;ndash; my wedding dress (and fitting nicely into it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That concern is largely want made new fitness app Vint catch my eye last week. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.joinvint.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Vint&lt;/a&gt; touts itself as a “peer to peer fitness marketplace.” I was drawn to the app because of the ability to book a personal trainer in my area for less than what I would have to pay for in a gym. Since my exercise choices are largely based on time (early mornings) and location, I was excited about Vint and what it could do to help me reach my wedding fitness goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now to be honest, my first few interactions with the app were a bit frustrating. It took me several attempts to find and successfully book a trainer. So in the vein of improvement (and because I want Vint to succeed), I decided to focus a guerrilla usability study on this app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Platform&lt;/strong&gt;: Android HTC&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem&lt;/strong&gt;: I use Vint to locate and book personal trainers in my area for early morning training sessions. I’ve had some trouble successfully finding and booking a trainer and wanted to test and see if other people had the same issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Users&lt;/strong&gt;: I targeted my local Laundromat (captive audience), my Lyft driver Paul and the nice people at Workshop Café. In total, I interviewed 6 people and recorded my time with them. You can view the videos &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qxuw8nq9v6cabq9/AACWB_ikpNnqZ83eI9rFUn3Wa?dl=0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;/images/Cafe.jpg&#34;  /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began by asking them the following filter questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ve been given $500 for a personal trainer. How would you go about finding one?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you used a personal trainer?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do you look for in a personal trainer? Tell me about price, type and location.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What was the process of finding a personal trainer process like?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you haven’t used a personal trainer, are you interested in getting one?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell me about why you haven’t used a personal trainer before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tasks&lt;/strong&gt;: I then asked users to complete 4 common tasks that I do most often within the app:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find an instructor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Book a session&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Request a new session time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cancel a session&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;: While every user experienced some specific difficulty with the app, there were 3 pain points that stood out as causing users the most frustration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;/images/Painpoints.jpg&#34;  /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pain Point #1: Canceling a Session&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I don’t know, I really don’t know.” –Paul&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a pain point that I am intimately familiar with. The first time I used Vint, I accidentally booked a session and could not find how to cancel it. As I found from talking to users, I am not the only one who had trouble with this task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To cancel a session, you must visit your profile page to view and cancel your bookings. Two of the users gave up during this task, not ever making it to the profile page. They shared with me that they would have contacted the trainer directly to cancel. Two other users who gave up on the task said that it was &amp;ldquo;just not possible to cancel a session.&amp;rdquo; Only one user was able to find and cancel a session without visiting other pages first in search of their booking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I’d rather something be in this first page than have to go back to my profile.” –Lisa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;: One of my users referenced what she called her favorite app- Urban Sitter. She said she would have liked to see Vint display recent bookings (with a cancel option) on the main page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used Urban Sitter as my inspiration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;/images/baby.jpg&#34;  /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;/images/Cancel2.jpg&#34;  /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(One fun bug we found was with the booking procces itself. After booking, error message would pop up saying that the booking was not successful. This caused users to try a second time, which produced no error message. Even though they received an error message, the first booking had gone through, which means users were stuck with two bookings. I&amp;rsquo;ve contacted Vint and they&amp;rsquo;ve since fixed the bug.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pain Point #2: Hard to notice categorization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It’s not giving me a lot of information.” –Oscar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of the users I spoke with noticed the exercise categories, dates and times at the bottom of each instructors picture on the main page. Three users remarked how they wished there were categories but none noticed the categorization that was present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;/images/Category2.jpg&#34;  /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pain Point #3: Confusing Function of the Vint Logo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I think this app is very poorly designed.” –Lisa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users would click on the Vint logo expecting it to take them back a page. Instead, the logo took them to the main page. Once in the main page, clicking on the logo would exit users out of the app. Get rid of the Vint logo after the homepage. It’s not needed because you know what app you are in. Instead, include the back arrow to show users how to go back in a page. (leaning on material design). They couldn’t see the back button because the logo asset is too big.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you compare the Vint logo to another app&amp;rsquo;s logo (in this case, Gmail), you can see that the Vint logo is larger. This might have added to the difficulty users had in noticing the back arrow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;/images/gmail.jpg&#34;  /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize that Vint&amp;rsquo;s design is in keeping with Andriod&amp;rsquo;s design principles but the logo isn&amp;rsquo;t needed- users know what app they&amp;rsquo;re in. Instead, I am leaning on material design and recommending that they remove the logo and increase the size of the back arrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;/images/Backbutton.jpg&#34;  /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is similar to Airbnb&amp;rsquo;s app:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;/images/Airbnb.jpg&#34;  /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that when you click on the Vint logo while on the main page, it will exit you out of the app. This happened to every user I interviewed and their reaction was a mixture of surprise, confusion and dismay.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several other recommendations that I will be addressing in the near future. Like&amp;hellip;.onboarding! This wasn&amp;rsquo;t something I could complete within a short timeframe but designing an onboarding experience would solve several problems I noticed, including cancelation, confusing profiles and unclear categorization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like how Pinterest does onboarding and recommend that Vint create a similar experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;/images/Pinterest%201.jpg&#34;  /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;/images/Pinterest%204.jpg&#34;  /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This design is also a little less intensive to create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So stay tuned for Vint: Part deux (and updates on how that wedding dress fits).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I do not work for Vint and am not affiliated with them in any way. I do use the app and am passionate about providing delightful user experiences.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
